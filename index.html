                <h2>Hi. I'm Diana Opondo</h2>
                <p><em>I am a digital nomad obsessed with the current remote lifestyle, currently pursuing a Software Engineering program at Moringa School, Kenya. My first interest in coding was in 2016 as a first-year student. I learned the basic “Hello World” coding using C and C++ languages in basic course units. I later rekindled my programming interests in 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown and studied HTML using YouTube videos until resuming work in 2021, (not coding-related). My journey with programming could serve as a gateway to a new career or boost my current job role.</em></p>
